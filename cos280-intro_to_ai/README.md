# COS 280 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

Instructor: Dr. Stefan Brandle

Credits: 3

Homework Time: 108 hours

> This course is intended to give you a survey of a very wide field of study. Topics covered include: problem solving, knowledge representation, learning, language processing, perception, robotics, reasoning, fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms, computer tools for AI, and knowledge-based systems. At the end of the course, you will have an understanding of what AI is and how it is likely to affect your career. You will also have a solid basis for deciding whether you wish to pursue the other courses in this computer science specialization.

## Skills

- Languages: Lisp, Arduino, Python, Java
- Robot control
- Game AI
- Logic backchaining

## Assignments

**Java:**

### [Neural Network Chess Engine](https://github.com/robert-swanson/NeuralNetworkChess)

Homework Time: 43 hours

Implements a chess board state scorer neural network model that (ideally but not practically) can be trained to extend the intelligence of a minimax algorithm.

**Lisp:**

### [Backchain Proof](./Backchain/)

Logic engine that can determine if conclusions are true given a list of predicates.

### [Degree Audit](./DegreeAudit/)

Given a degrees requirements, and a personâ€™s course plan, determine if the person can graduate or what classes they need to take.

**Robot Control:**

### [Line Follow](./LineFollow/)

Follows a tape line and stops at the point on the line closest to the closest object.

### [Navigate Maze](./NavigateMaze/)

Navigates a pre-known wooden maze, to get from point A to point B.

### [Pointer Robot](./PointerRobot/)

Points to the closest object (detected with ultrasonic sensors).

**Python**

### [Tic-Tac-Toe](./TicTacToe/)

Implements a minimax tic tac tow AI.
