          "description": "The course focuses on practical understanding and application of computing technology in educational, small business, or organizational environments. Specific topics include an overview of operating systems, application software, computing hardware, telecommunications, networking, and information management systems and analysis. In addition, it heavily emphasizes the impact of technology on modern society and the ethical issues related to use of information and communication systems. This course is offered through Taylor University Online (TUO) and does not count toward any major, minor, or foundational core curriculum requirement for residential students."

Programming concepts are introduced incrementally in order to solve increasingly complex problems. Good algorithm design and program structure are emphasized. Introductory data structures and software engineering principles are stressed. An introduction to object-oriented programming is included. Three hours of lecture and two hours of lab per week. Meets foundation core computation requirement.",
