Neither is placed over the other. Both Adam and Eve individually and willingly decide to eat of the forbidden fruit. They are then seperated from God and kicked out of the Garden of Eden because of their sin. Only after the fall does Adam name Eve, possibly out of an act of dominance over eve. This may have been the begining of the trend for patriarchy, which was not an institution placed by God as His original intention for mankind.","reference":"Genesis 1-3","url":"https://www.goodfreephotos.com/albums/netherlands/other/garden-of-europe-in-lisse-netherlands.jpg"},{"position":3,"time":"2000 BC","title":"Hagar","description":"Hagar was Sarah’s slave who was the mothered Ishmael, whom she had with Abraham upon Sarah’s instruction. Often highlighted as one who rebelled against her master, she was also one of very few to name God. Just as God promised a nation through Issac, He also promised to Hagar that a nation would come through Ishmael.","reference":"Genesis 15-23","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Desert_road_camel-other.jpg"},{"position":4,"time":"2000 BC","title":"Tamar","description":"One of the most misunderstood women of the Bible, Tamar is oft-viewed as a seductress who tricked Judah for her own maniacal purposes. However, she acted as one who was more in the right than Judah (as he himself stated). She acted in the pursuit of justice for her first husband, and bore a son through Judah when he was unmarried.","reference":"Genesis 38","url":"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/03/21/10/44/desert-1270345_960_720.jpg"},{"position":6,"time":"1500 BC","title":"Rahab","description":"Some label Rahab as a prostitute who was seducing the righteous Israelite spies. However, she is the epitome of one who is saved by God due to her faith and despite her pagan heritage. As for the righteous spies, there seems to be no pure reason for their nightly visit to her house.","reference":"Joshua 1-2","url":"http://res.freestockphotos.biz/pictures/9/9134-a-castle-wall-against-a-blue-sky-pv.jpg"},{"position":9,"time":"1200 BC","title":"Ruth","description":"Ruth gave up her old life to follow Naomi and her God. Though some interpretations of her interaction with Boaz portray her as potentially attempting to seduce Boaz, contextual and cultural evidence seem to indicate otherwise. Though, as often is the case, consensus on interpretation is impossible, it’s important to recognize that Ruth was faithfully obeying Naomi and the marriage customs of the time.","reference":"Book of Ruth","url":"https://libreshot.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/field.jpg"},{"position":10,"time":"1200 BC","title":"Deborah","description":"Deborah was one of Israel’s judges in the time before the kings and is a great testament against the idea that women are unable to lead God’s people. Some argue that God “had” to use Deborah because there was no righteous man to be found. They argue that Barak showed lack of faith, and therefore inability to lead, through his asking Deborah to come with him to battle. However, the text portrays both Barak and Deborah both as fit leaders for Israel, without any implication that Deborah was any less qualified as a Judge because she was a woman.","reference":"Judges 4-5","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Buck_Mountain_Grand_Teton_NP1.jpg/2560px-Buck_Mountain_Grand_Teton_NP1.jpg"},{"position":12,"time":"1000 BC","title":"Bathsheba","description":"Bathsheba is one who’s plight is often overlook upon examination of David’s story. Some claim she was intentionally kbathing outside, or in such a way that others might see her, possibly trying to seduce those such as David who may happen to see her. However, it is important to remember that the Bible never says she was outside, and it was common etiquette of the time to avoid looking out upon the houses in the city, because many did not have the space to bathe privately, and yet David","reference":"2 Samuel 10-12","url":"https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2756/4277357072_d67e6cb13c_b.jpg"},{"position":14,"time":"600 BC","title":"Huldah","description":"Huldah is woman many have never heard of, who gave Josiah the Word of God after he’d found the unearthed scriptures. She acknowledge the authority God’s message as far beyond the authority of Israel’s king. It is also important to note that Huldah voiced God’s message even while Jeremiah and Zephaniah where available prophets.","reference":"2 Kings 22","url":"https://live.staticflickr.com/1070/1292725276_f3b359408e_b.jpg"},{"position":15,"time":"500 BC","title":"Vashti","description":"Vashti was ejected from the palace of Ahasuerus (Xerxes), the king of Persia during the time of Esther. Though the reason the kings advisors recommended this action was, as they claimed, that Vashti dishonored her husband, it was she who was dishonored by the kings request, and her rejection may have even been in the interest of her husbands honor on top of her own.","reference":"Esther 1","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Royal_Palace_of_Afif-Abad_Garden_in_Shiraz%2C_Persia%2C_2013.jpg"},{"position":17,"time":"0 BC","title":"Virgin Mary","description":"Mary is a woman of much significance and interdenominational conflict, so it is import to understand her importance to the extent that the Gospels indicate that we ought to. The Catholic side must be careful not to revere her as one who is beyond what she is described by the Bible, and must put their focus on the work that Christ. The Protestant side must be careful not to swing to far in the other direction by denying her importance as one who was favored by God, and chosen to bear and mother the savior of the world.","reference":"Gospels","url":"https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTxD7chaUz-BSF7s-cwQTVqChBU2h__hD9P3yjk3s0bxf8zCfJu"},{"position":18,"time":"30 AD","title":"The Woman at the Well","description":"The woman at the well is generally assumed to be an unfaithful wife, due to Jesus’ statement that she has had 5 husbands and the man that she was currently with was not her husband. However, such assumptions that she was hopping from husband to husband don’t correlate well with the fact that the towns people trusted her word enough to go out and see Jesus. Such assumptions miss out on the possibility that her husbands had died, and that the man she was with, may have just been someone who was responsible for her after her last husband had died.","reference":"John 4","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/Well%2C_Prague_Satalice.jpg"},{"position":19,"time":"30 AD","title":"Mary Magdalene","description":"Mary Magdalene is a heavily misunderstood character in the New Testament due to her name shared with many woman at the time. She was not the so called “sinner” Mary who had poured out the perfume on the feet of Jesus, and she was not Mary of Bethany the sister of Martha and Lazarus. She was the Mary who had faithfully followed Jesus through his ministry, through His crucifixion, and was the first to witness his resurrection.","reference":"Matthew 27-28, Mark 15-16, John 19-20","url":"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2018/04/16/22/46/empty-tomb-3326100_960_720.jpg"}]}')
