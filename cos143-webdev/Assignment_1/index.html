		<h1> Taylor University </h1>
		<h2> From the perspective of a freshman </h2>
		<p>
			When touring Colleges it can be very difficult to get a good view at actual student life without wondering whether or not your experiecnces are fabricated to increase your likelyhood of attending a given university. This was a problem I thought often about during my college visiting experience. When I visited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_University">Taylor University</a>, I was struck by its apparent emphasis on community, but was slightly critical as to the authenticity of my experience. Still, no other college I visited came anywhere near to Taylor in the area of student life and community. For this and other reasons I chose to go here, and I can comfirm the authenticity of Taylor's community life, even as an initial skeptic

			One important thing to note about Taylor life is that time management skills are heavily tested. Although the problem is universal across all schools, Taylor's abundance of social activites add a unique aspect to the time managemnt dilemma. There are so many social events which are good in an of themselves to go to and are socially productive. But you must be able to turn down such activities in order to make time for other things such as homework (obviously), sleep, and alone time.
