# COS 121 Foundations of Computer Science

<class redacted from public repo to protect from cheating>

Hours: 4

Professor: Dr. Stefan Brandle

Homework Time: 32 hours

> This 4-credit hour course builds on COS 120 by emphasizing object-oriented programming and including concepts of computer science such as computational complexity, simulation, recursion, and an overview of a number of other foundational computer science topics. COS 121 is a prerequisite for a number of other computer science courses.
>
> The use and implementation of data structures such as lists, stacks, and queues are introduced as they are needed in developing algorithms for problems studied. Additional topics include source code versioning, unit testing, and code refactoring. Three hours of lecture and two hours of lab per week.
>
> This course is required of all computer science majors and is a prerequisite for many upper level COS courses. A grade of C- or better in COS 120, “Introduction to Computational Problem Solving”, is a prerequisite for this course. According to the standard policy, a grade of C- or better must be obtained in this course to meet the COS major requirement.

## Skills

## Assignments

### [Infection Simulator](./projects/infection)

Uses command line interface to visually simulate cells, viruses and how they interact.

### [Battleships](./projects/battleships)

Implements an AI that can play battleships.

### [Checkout Simulator](./labs/Checkout)

Simulates a store checkout line to test whether it is more efficient to have one line per register, or to have one for all.

### [Jumping Knights](./labs/knights)

Determines minimum number of jumps a chess knight must take to go from point A to point B.

Implements a mutable array datatype using C++ arrays.

### [Linked List](./labs/ListLinked)

Implements a mutable linked list data type using C++.

### [Maze](./labs/Maze)

Determines whether mazes are solvable and visualizes the solution.

### [String](./labs/String)

Creates a mutable string data structure in C++.

### [Unit Test](./labs/unit_test)
