# SYS 411 Machine Learning

*class redacted from public repo to protect from cheating*

Instructor: Dr. Art White

Credits: 3

Homework Time: 59 hours

> This course is intended to extend your knowledge of how computers can be made to simulate intelligence by giving them the ability to learn (in some cases, without supervisory feedback). Major topics covered include: statistical pattern recognition, neural networks, genetic algorithms, and large-scale ML. At the end of the course, you will have an understanding of how to select machine learning paradigms that are appropriate for a given problem. You will be able to create, configure, test and validate solution systems involving these machine learning paradigms.
