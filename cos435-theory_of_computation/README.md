# COS 435: Theory of Computation

Instructor: **Dr. Josh Hibschman**

Credits: 3

Homework Time: 32 hr

> Theory of computation (TOC) is a theoretical treatment of what can be computed and how efficiently computation can be done. Topics include models of computation and automata, deterministic and nondeterministic compu- tations, and formal language theory.
>
> TOC is a branch of Computer Science that is concerned with how problems can be solved using algorithms, how efficiently they can be solved, how hard they are to solve, and how hard it is to verify whether they were solved. Real-world computers perform computations that by nature run like mathematical models to solve problems in systematic ways. This course will provide an introduction to TOC through the following teaching methods.
>
> 1. Applying the principles, processes, and models of computation in independent projects,
> 2. Discovering both how to generalize and identify limitations for computational models from reading and problems,
> 3. Exploring student-driven design in a hands-on group project,
> 4. Exploring applications and tradeoffs between theoretical models,
> 5. Creating and evaluating prototypes of advanced models,
>
> This course is an elective available to all students in computer science and is an option in systems. According to the standard policy, a grade of C- or better must be obtained in this course to meet the COS major or systems requirement.
